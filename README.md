📊 IBM HR Employee Attrition Prediction
📌 Overview
This project analyzes the IBM HR Analytics dataset to predict employee attrition and identify key factors influencing employee turnover.
The project combines Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical aggregation, and machine learning models to generate actionable HR insights.
🎯 Objectives
Analyze patterns contributing to employee attrition
Perform data cleaning and missing value analysis
Conduct age-wise and attrition-based trend analysis
Train and compare multiple classification models
Evaluate model performance using standard metrics
🛠️ Tech Stack
Python
Pandas
NumPy
Scikit-learn
XGBoost
Plotly Express
Matplotlib
📂 Project Workflow
1️⃣ Data Exploration & Preprocessing
Inspected dataset structure and feature distribution
Checked and handled missing values
Encoded categorical variables
Performed feature selection and preprocessing
2️⃣ Age-wise Attrition Analysis
Grouped employees by Age and Attrition status (Yes/No)
Counted employees in each category
Analyzed trends across different age groups
Visualized patterns using interactive line charts
3️⃣ Machine Learning Models
Implemented and compared multiple classification algorithms:
Logistic Regression
Random Forest
K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
XGBoost
After hyperparameter tuning, the best-performing model achieved:
85.71% Accuracy
Evaluation metrics used:
Accuracy
Precision
Recall
F1-Score
📊 Key Insights
Attrition varies significantly across certain age groups
Overtime and job satisfaction are strong predictors of attrition
Machine learning models can help organizations proactively identify high-risk employees
🔮 Future Improvements
Model deployment using Flask or FastAPI
Real-time prediction system
Integration with HR management platforms
