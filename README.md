📊 IBM HR Employee Attrition Prediction

📌 Overview:

• This project analyzes the IBM HR Analytics dataset to predict employee attrition and identify key factors influencing employee turnover.
• The project combines Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA), statistical aggregation, and machine learning models to generate actionable HR insights.

🎯 Objectives:

• Analyze patterns contributing to employee attrition
• Perform data cleaning and missing value analysis
• Conduct age-wise and attrition-based trend analysis
• Train and compare multiple classification models
• Evaluate model performance using standard metrics

🛠️ Tech Stack:
• Python
• Pandas
• NumPy
• Scikit-learn
• XGBoost
• Plotly Express
• Matplotlib

📂 Project Workflow:
1️⃣ Data Exploration & Preprocessing
• Inspected dataset structure and feature distribution
• Checked and handled missing values
• Encoded categorical variables
• Performed feature selection and preprocessing
2️⃣ Age-wise Attrition Analysis
• Grouped employees by Age and Attrition status (Yes/No)
• Counted employees in each category
• Analyzed trends across different age groups
• Visualized patterns using interactive line charts
3️⃣ Machine Learning Models
Implemented and compared:
• Logistic Regression
• Random Forest
• K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN)
• XGBoost

After hyperparameter tuning, the best-performing model achieved:
85.71% Accuracy

Evaluation metrics used:
• Accuracy
• Precision
• Recall
• F1-Score

📊 Key Insights:
• Attrition varies significantly across certain age groups
• Overtime and job satisfaction are strong predictors of attrition
• Machine learning models can help organizations proactively identify high-risk employees

🔮 Future Improvements:
• Model deployment using Flask or FastAPI
• Real-time prediction system
• Integration with HR management platforms
